Obersevations while exploring the database.

1. The documentation is a bit of a figure it out yourself.
-More of a note than a complaint.
-More exploration and setting up a proper way to store the data should make negate the problem.

2. Supplying images may not work the way that I would like.  Scrapping the web with Beautiful Soup or another program may help but may not work as intended.  It would be very difficult to check all sources unless I simplify what would or would not be worthy of images.

3. Size maybe a bit of an issue.  Saving the information myself may help as making calls to the API is semi limited in the methods that they allow.
-They have built in methods but relying on that to populate the page may not be very reliable due to this not being a recent or well maintained API.

4. Implementation of the Memory Alpha and the Memory Beta database would more than likely be necessary.

5. Files will be necessary to save the data, because as mentioned the features of this API are limited and the docs are not the best.

6. https://www.thelcars.com/ will really help for styling.  Using this maybe required to adding styling to focus on the storying and retrieving of data.
